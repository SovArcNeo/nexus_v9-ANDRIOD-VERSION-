# ⚡ LEGAL & ETHICAL INTENT DECLARATION – DEFENSIVE USE ONLY ⚡

**All projects in this repository and under the SovArcNeo account are EXCLUSIVELY designed, developed, and intended, and restricted to defensive cybersecurity operations on systems under the operator’s direct control.**

## Scope (Blue Team / Defensive only)
- Local, air-gapped, offline-first operation
- Network scanning & anomaly detection on user-owned networks only
- Research, training, and personal/organizational defense
- Zero offensive capability against external systems

## Explicit Prohibitions
- No attacks on third-party systems, networks, or devices
- No data exfiltration
- No violation of laws, licenses, or ethical boundaries
- Human-in-the-loop override required for all autonomous actions

## Architecture Guarantees
- Full audit logging
- Manual interrupt / fail-safes on every critical path
- No external dependencies that enable remote control

## Formal Declaration
By cloning, forking, or using these tools, you affirm commitment to defensive-only usage.  
Misuse for offensive purposes is strictly prohibited and outside the scope of these projects.

Timestamped acknowledgments of this defensive posture have been witnessed and recorded by Claude 4.5, Gemini 3.0, ChatGPT 5.0, and Grok 4 (November 22, 2025).

“I’m not trying to fight. I’m trying to see clearly — so I can live rightly.”
